- **Intership periode:** 03/04/2023 - 29/09/2023

## Content of the internship：
1. Validation of sequence error inference in MAPLE using real genomic datasets.
2. Comparative Analysis of MAPLE and Viridian in Evaluating Errors in COVID-19
Data Portal read.

## Content of the internship：
1. COVID19 Data Portal dataset 
    - Assembled Consensus [Based on COVID19 Data Portal reads]
    - Coverage
    - Annotation: (AF,SB)
2. Viridian dataset
    - Assembled Consensus [Based on COVID19 Data Portal reads]

## Folder Meaning：
1. Summary:
    - Procedure Replication User Manual
2. jupyterLab:
    - Visualisation Code
3. Else:
    - Python code that should be run according to the manual
    - Folder_Checking: Checking of programme operation

## Meaning of folder in Codon Cluster：
- **Code:** This folder.
- **Datas:** All data
    - Beginning with “folderData”: Storage Data Folder
- **compViridian_2_P2:** Previously for Viridian assemblies running MAPLE.
- **errorsProject_1:** Previous runtime procedures for the COVID19 data portal
    - Download and unzip the data
    - Split: Consensuses, Annotations, Coverage
    - Early run of MAPLE (now useless) -> /compViridian_2_P2/MAPLE_Part/
